            <h2>Event Planning</h2>
            <h3> Mannheim is a Unesco City of Music, known for the many different flavors that make up this boiling pot of sound and culture. People from all walks of life bring their talents and life experience here and are looking for an audience. Thats where we come in. The LuvMusic staff is made up off real musicians, producers, venue owners and promoters who know the what the area has to offer and are intimately connected with the music scene. It is our pleasure to bring the scene together at our various partner locations to share culture, more than a few laughs and a great time. Looking for a stage to play on? Join up. Looking for an audience to be a part of? Let us know. Just want to hang, meet people and have a good time? We love to crack open an Eichbaum and have a chat and then tune up for a jam. This is the community for you.</h3>

            <h2>Jam Base</h2>
            <h3>If you play an instrument or have a vocal talent, you know how difficult it can be to find openminded individuals with whom to share your talents. LuvMusic has you covered with our Jam Database. Here we safely and securely collect and store profiles of our interested members concerning the instruments they play, the genres they prefer and their openness to jam out with others. If a group of outgoing individuals are looking for a keyboarder, violinist or singer and you happen to fit that profile and inform us that you are free to jam, LuvMusic can facilitate that connection. So whether you are new to the area or just now getting your skills up to snuff, LuvMusic is a resource you can use to build that network that can help you more deeply enjoy the hobby you love. </h3>
