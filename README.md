* The Header
  * Here the Header is used as a container for the Logo and Navigation bar.

* The background image
  * This feature acts as a kind of fixed Hero Image and scrolls as the user engages with the        initial calls to action on the landing page. This is to provide dynamics and also to begin calls to explore the page further.
